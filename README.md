This is a simple Ember experiment, to learn routing, variables and more, using the CDN signup at [http://www.i5labs.com/cdnIntroduction.html](http://www.i5labs.com/cdnIntroduction.html) as a base.

TO DO
  * When sign up is clicked, replace with specific plan fragment
  * Ensure plan shows consistently (clicking how still shows the correct plan if plan is chosen)
  * Integrate design from i5labs
  * Integrate with [https://github.com/jason/closeioweb2lead](https://github.com/jason/closeioweb2lead)
  * Deploy to Heroku
